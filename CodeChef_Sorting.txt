1. The Smallest pair

    You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.
    Input
    The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

    The first line of each description consists of a single integer N.

    The second line of each description contains N space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.

    Output
    For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the smallest possible sum for the corresponding test case.

    Constraints
    T = 105, N = 2 : 13 points.
    T = 105, 2 ≤ N ≤ 10 : 16 points.
    T = 1000, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 : 31 points.
    T = 10, 2 ≤ N ≤ 105 : 40 points.
    1 ≤ ai ≤ 106

    Input 
    1
    4
    5 1 3 4
    Output
    4
    Explanation:
    Here we pick a2 and a3. Their sum equals to 1 + 3 = 4.

2. Racing Horses

    Problem
    Chef is very fond of horses. He enjoys watching them race. As expected, he has a stable full of horses. He, along with his friends, goes to his stable during the weekends to watch a few of these horses race. Chef wants his friends to enjoy the race and so he wants the race to be close. This can happen only if the horses are comparable on their skill i.e. the difference in their skills is less.

    There are N horses in the stable. The skill of the horse i is represented by an integer S[i]. The Chef needs to pick 2 horses for the race such that the difference in their skills is minimum. This way, he would be able to host a very interesting race. Your task is to help him do this and report the minimum difference that is possible between 2 horses in the race.

    Input:
    First line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
    Every test case starts with a line containing the integer N.
    The next line contains N space separated integers where the i-th integer is S[i].

    Output:
    For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum difference that is possible.

    Constraints:
    1 ≤ T ≤ 10
    2 ≤ N ≤ 5000
    1 ≤ S[i] ≤ 1000000000
    Sample 1
    Input
    1
    5
    4 9 1 32 13
    Output
    3
    Explanation:
    The minimum difference can be achieved if we pick horses with skills 1 and 4 for the race.

3. Maximum Weight difference
    Problem
    Chef has gone shopping with his 5-year old son. They have bought N items so far. The items are numbered from 1 to N, and the item i weighs Wi grams.

    Chef's son insists on helping his father in carrying the items. He wants his dad to give him a few items. Chef does not want to burden his son. But he won't stop bothering him unless he is given a few items to carry. So Chef decides to give him some items. Obviously, Chef wants to give the kid less weight to carry.

    However, his son is a smart kid. To avoid being given the bare minimum weight to carry, he suggests that the items are split into two groups, and one group contains exactly K items. Then Chef will carry the heavier group, and his son will carry the other group.

    Help the Chef in deciding which items should the son take. Your task will be simple. Tell the Chef the maximum possible difference between the weight carried by him and the weight carried by the kid.

    Input:
    The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test contains two space-separated integers N and K. The next line contains N space-separated integers W1, W2, ..., WN.

    Output:
    For each test case, output the maximum possible difference between the weights carried by both in grams.

    Constraints:
    1 ≤ T ≤ 100
    1 ≤ K < N ≤ 100
    1 ≤ Wi ≤ 100000 (105)
    Sample 1:
    Input
    2
    5 2
    8 4 5 2 10
    8 3
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    Output
    17
    2
    Explanation:
    Case #1: The optimal way is that Chef gives his son K=2 items with weights 2 and 4.
     Chef carries the rest of the items himself. Thus the difference is: (8+5+10) ? (4+2) = 23 ? 6 = 17.

    Case #2: Chef gives his son 3 items and he carries 5 items himself.

4. Maximise the Subsequence Sum

    Problem
    Chef has an array AA containing NN integers. The integers of the array can be positive, negative, or even zero.

    Chef allows you to choose at most KK elements of the array and multiply them by -1−1.

    Find the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain if you choose the elements of the subsequence optimally.

    Note: A sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. 
    For example, [3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4].
     Note that empty sequence is also a subsequence.

    Input Format
    The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
    The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, K.
    The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A_1, A_2,..., A_N
    
    Output Format
    For each test case, print a single line containing one integer - the maximum sum of a subsequence you can obtain.

    Constraints
    1≤T≤15
    1≤N≤10^5
    0≤K≤N
    -10^4≤Ai≤10^4
    Sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^6

    5 0
    -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
    3 3
    1 2 3
    Output
    22
    0
    6
    Explanation:
    Test case 11: It is optimal to multiply -10, -4 with -1 and 
    then take the subsequence [6, 10, 4, 2][6,10,4,2].
